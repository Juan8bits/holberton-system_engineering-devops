## Learning Objectives:bulb:
What you should learn from this project:

* be able to draw a diagram covering the web stack you built with the sysadmin/devops track projects
* be able to explain what each component is doing
* be able to explain system redundancy
* Know all the mentioned acronyms: LAMP, SPOF, QPS

---

### [0. Simple Web Stack](./0-simple_web_stack)
* Design a one server web infrastructure that hosts the website that is reachable via www.foobar.com
* Use:
    * 1 server
    * 1 web server (Nginx)
    * 1 application server
    * 1 application files (your code base)
    * 1 database (MySQL)
    * 1 domain name foobar.com configured with a www record that points to your server IP 8.8.8.8

### [1. Distributed Web Infrastructure](./1-distributed_web_infrastructure)
* Design a three server web infrastructure that hosts the website www.foobar.com.
* Use:
    * 2 servers
    * 1 web server (Nginx)
    * 1 application server
    * 1 load-balancer (HAproxy)
    * 1 set of application files (your code base)
    * 1 database (MySQL)

### [2. Secured and Monitored Web Infrastructure](./2-secured_and_monitored_web_infrastructure)
* Design a three server web infrastructure that hosts the website www.foobar.com, it must be secured, serve encrypted traffic, and be monitored.
* Use:
    * 3 firewalls
    * 1 SSL certificate to serve www.foobar.com over HTTPS
    * 3 monitoring clients (data collector for Sumologic or other monitoring services)
